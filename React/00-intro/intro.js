React JS: Library/Framework to create user interfaces

It provides speed, components, Declarative Development, nesting components, Isomorfism
and Speed developing it.

Speed: Rendering speed, it has a Virtual DOM and it only reloads the elements that changed

Components: allow to separate the user interface in independent pieces, re-usable and
think of each piece individually. Working with components forces our development to be
maintainable.

Nesting components: Components can be nested, in a way that superior components transfer data to lower level components.

Communication between them is unidirectional, and it uses events so that lower level components are recognized by superior ones.

Data goes down the tree, events go up the tree.

Data and functionalities in the superior part of the tree
Events and execution orders from parent or superior level in the lower part of the tree.

Declarative programming: Declarative programming focuses on the end result, while imperative programming focuses on how to get there. For example, when you jump in a taxi, you declare to the driver where you want to go. You don't tell him how to get there by providing turn-by-turn directions. The turn-by-turn directions are akin to imperative programming.

Isomorfism: Rendering in server or in client.

Speed developing: in React we have all functionalities that Jquery provides.
Both technologies can work together, although its not necesary tp use jquery in our projects.


Is based in async events.
